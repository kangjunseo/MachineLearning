# MachineLearning

In this repository, I will upload my every studies about `Machine Learning`.  
Which includes school class, personal study, and team study.  
<br/>
`Basics` dir will include usage of basic tools such as `Numpy`, `Pandas`, and basic usage of `Scikit-Learn`.
<br/>
Currently, I'm studying basic theory of ML, and soon I will create `kaggle` dir, which contains my answer notebooks (may be converted to markdown and extra code).
