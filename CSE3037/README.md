## CSE3037 - Machine Learning Algorithms (Spring 2022)

#### Course Intro

This course introduces various `machine learning algorithms` and their applications.
Students will learn how to `mathematically` analyze learning algorithms and apply those algorithms
to `real world data`. Some experiments will be performed in the class with `python` codes. Major
topics to be covered in the class include `inference` using multivariate Gaussain models, probabilistic
graphical models, latent variable models including `deep generative models`, `stochastic gradient
descent`, `convex optimization`, and `Gaussian processes`.
